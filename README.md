***

- NumPy is the most important libraries of the so-called scientific stackâ€”requires a single command only. 
- When the installation takes place on a machine with an Intel processor, the procedure automatically installs the Intel Math Kernel Library `mkl`, which speeds up numerical operations not only for NumPy but also for a few other scientific Python packages.
